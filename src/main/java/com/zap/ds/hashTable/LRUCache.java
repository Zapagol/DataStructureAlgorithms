/**
 * We use two data structures to implement an LRU Cache.
 *
 * 1. Queue which is implemented using a doubly linked list. The maximum size of the queue will be equal
 * to the total number of frames available (cache size). The most recently used pages will be near front
 * end and least recently pages will be near the rear end.
 *
 * 2. A Hash with page number as key and address of the corresponding queue node as value.
 *
 * - In practice, LRU cache is a kind of Queue â€” if an element is reaccessed, it goes to the end of the
 * eviction order
 * - This queue will have a specific capacity as the cache has a limited size. Whenever a new element is
 * brought in, it is added at the head of the queue. When eviction happens, it happens from the tail of
 * the queue.
 * - Hitting data in the cache must be done in constant time, which isn't possible in Queue! But, it is
 * possible with Java's HashMap data structure
 * - Removal of the least recently used element must be done in constant time, which means for the implementation
 * of Queue, we'll use DoublyLinkedList instead of SingleLinkedList or an array
 *
 * <h>So, the LRU cache is nothing but a combination of the DoublyLinkedList and the HashMap as shown below:<h/>
 *
 * <LRU Algorithm/>
 * The LRU algorithm is pretty easy! If the key is present in HashMap, it's a cache hit; else, it's a cache miss.
 *
 * We'll follow two steps after a cache miss occurs:
 *      - Add a new element in front of the list.
 *      - Add a new entry in HashMap and refer to the head of the list.
 * And, we'll do two steps after a cache hit:
 *      - Remove the hit element and add it in front of the list.
 *      - Update HashMap with a new reference to the front of the list.
