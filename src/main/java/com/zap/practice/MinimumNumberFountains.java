 * Count minimum number of fountains to be activated to cover the entire garden.

 * - In each position of the N length garden,a fountain has been installed.
 * - Given an array a[]such that a[i] describes the coverage limit of ith fountain.
 * - A fountain can cover the range from the position max(i â€“ a[i], 1) to min(i + a[i], N).
 * - In beginning, all the fountains are switched off. The task is to find the minimum number of fountains
 * needed to be activated such that the whole N-length garden can be covered by water.
